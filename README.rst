mwlib - MediaWiki parser and utility library
======================================================================


About This Fork/Branch
======================================================================
mwlib does not yet officially support Python 3. This branch is a more
lightweight version I have ported to Python 3 (I did not include
any backwards compatibility). I have tried to include only the Wikimedia
markup parsing functionality â€“ that is the only functionality I needed,
and I didn't want to port the entire library. It's mainly meant to be
a substitute until the official library is ported over.


Overview
======================================================================
mwlib provides a library for parsing MediaWiki articles and
converting them to different output formats. mwlib is used by
wikipedia's "Print/export" feature in order to generate PDF documents
from wikipedia articles.

Documentation
=================
Please visit http://mwlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html for
detailed documentation.
